kernel namespaces:
  created when a container is run
  container processes cannot see or affect other processes
  each container has its own network stack
control groups:
  created when a container is run
  provide resource accounting and limiting
  ensure no containers exhaust host resources
docker daemon attack surface:
  small, but take appropriate security measures
  only run docker on a host
  only let trusted users control the Docker daemon, ran with root priveleges
linux kernel capabilities:
  docker runs containers with restricted capabilities
  even os containers don't get full root priveleges

docker swarm cluster
mutually authenticated tls (mtls):
  manually rotating certificates is painful
  rotating security certificates without downtime is even harder
  mtls is built into docker swarm and solves these challenges
managers:
  maintain cluster state
  schedule services
  serve as swarm http api endpoints
workers:
  sole purpose is to execute container workloads

docker content trust:
  important to know that the image you wanted is the image you received
  especially when pulling images from internet sites or large orgs
  docker notary is an open-source project that provides the ability to
  digitally sign content and is also included with dtr
  enforces a policy that any operations with a remote registry require signed images
  cmd: export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
  once enabled, the docker push will try to sign an image
  once enabled, docker pull will only download signed images
  with UCP, you can ensure that only signed images can be run

identifying roles in ucp
docker access control model:
  subjects:
    user, team, organization, service account
  roles:
    subjects are granted roles
    defines what can be done:
      view only, restricted control, full control
  resources:
    swarm collections, kubernetes namespaces
    collections and namespaces together are called resource sets
  grants:
    combination of a subject, role, and resource set
    grants are the access control list; "ACL" of docker UCP
