layering with docker images:
  images are made up of multiple read-only layers
  multiple containers are typically based on the same image
  when an image is instantiated into a container,
  a top writable layer is created (which is deleted when the container is removed)
  docker uses storage drivers to manage the contents of the image layers and writable container layer
  each storage driver handles the implemenation differently,
  but all drivers use stackable image layers and the copy-on-write strategy
  docker image union filesystem:
    writable layer (when running)
